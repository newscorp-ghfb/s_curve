## Navbar Tools

In addition to traditional navigation, the navbar can also display a set of tools (e.g. social actions, GitHub view or edit actions, etc.) A tool definition consists of an icon name and an href to follow when clicked. For icon, use the icon name of any of the 1,300+ Bootstrap Icons.

For example:

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
```yaml
website:
  navbar:
    tools:
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com
      - icon: github
        menu:
          - text: Source Code
            url:  https://code.com
          - text: Report a Bug
            url:  https://bugs.com
```

:::

Tools specified for a navigation bar will appear on the right side of the Navbar. If you specify a dark theme or reader more for your website, the controls for those options will appear with any specified tools.

When the navbar is collapsed into a menu smaller screens, the tools will be placed at the bottom of the menu.

## Responsive Navbar

We've updated the responsive behavior of the navbar to improve the usability of Quarto websites on mobile devices. Changes include:

- When the items in a navbar collapse into a menu, we've moved the 'hamburger' button which controls the menu to the right side of the navbar. This makes it easier to access the menu on mobile devices.

- When the items in a navbar collapse into a menu, we play the search icon on right side of the navbar (rather than placing in the collapsed menu). This makes search always available, even when on small screens.

## Responsive Sidebar

We've updated the responsive behavior of the sidebar to improve the usability of Quarto websites on mobile devices. Changes include:

- The collapsed sidebar now appears as a vertically smaller band which includes a 'sidebar' icon on the left side. Clicking this icon will expand the sidebar to full width. In addition, this collapsed view includes 'breadcrumbs' for the current page which allow simple navigation up the hierarchy.

- When revealed, the sidebar will now animate from the side of the screen.
